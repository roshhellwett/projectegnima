## ✨ About

**Egnima** is a modular, C/C++-based project crafted to explore system-level logic, modular programming, and inter-component communication. Whether you’re learning or building, Egnima’s structure offers a strong foundation for experimenting with sender-receiver logic, encryption, or data flow simulation.

> 🧠 *Think of it as your C/C++ sandbox for mastering modular architecture and build automation.*

---

## 🧩 Features

✅ Clean modular structure — separated headers & source files
✅ Modern CMake build support
✅ Cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows
✅ Extendable logic for encoding, networking, or simulation
✅ Lightweight and beginner-friendly

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

* 🧰 **CMake** ≥ 3.10
* 💻 **C/C++ Compiler** (GCC / Clang / MSVC)
* 🧱 *(Optional)* **Make** or **Ninja** build tools

---

### 🏗️ Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roshhellwett/Egnima.git
cd Egnima
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

> 💡 Tip: Use `cmake -G "Ninja" ..` for faster builds.

---

### ▶️ Running

After building, you’ll find the executable inside the `build` folder.

```bash
./Egnima [options]
```

Example:

```bash
./Egnima --mode sender --file input.txt
./Egnima --mode receiver --output output.txt
```

---

## 💡 Usage

| Mode        | Description                       | Example Command                                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 📨 Sender   | Sends data from an input file     | `./Egnima --mode sender --file input.txt`      |
| 📥 Receiver | Receives and saves data to output | `./Egnima --mode receiver --output output.txt` |

> ⚡ Experiment with different data sources or add your own algorithms inside the modules!
